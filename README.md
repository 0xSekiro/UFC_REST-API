# UFC_REST-API
Hello everybody

That's my UFC REST API using Node js (Express, MongoDB) which perform CRUD operations (Create Fighter, Read Fighter/s , Update Fighter, Delete Fighter) from database
Note: Using local database on port 27017

Code dependencies: 
- express | routing and middlewares
- mongoose | dealing with MongoDB databasse
- morgan | logging 
- dotenv | read environment variables from config.env file and add it to process.env object

Dev dependencies: 
- nodemon 

Note: you will find all dependencies in package.json file

Also i tried to apply MVC architecture but without any view for templates because it just an API

it is just the beginning and i still learning ...
